# Portfolio-A4YTY
Мой первый сайт для портфолио

I am learning web development to work remotely with international clients and improve my professional skills.
I live in Vladivostok and build an online portfolio to find freelance projects in different countries.

My goals are to become a confident front‑end developer, build stable remote income and collaborate with clients from various countries.
I want to grow in IT, support my family and have the flexibility to live and work in different places.
